# ShineSwap - Professional DeFi Token Swap DApp

![ShineSwap UI](./shine-swap-pro/public/screenshot.png)

A sleek, professional, and fully functional Decentralized Application (DApp) for swapping between ETH and a custom ERC20 token (SHINE). Built with a modern tech stack, it features a monochrome, animated UI and fetches all transaction history directly from the blockchain.

This project was built to showcase advanced skills in smart contract development, front-end integration, and modern UI/UX design for the DeFi space.
